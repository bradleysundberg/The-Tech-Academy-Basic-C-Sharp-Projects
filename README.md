# AbstractClassExample
This project shows how abstract classes work in C#. It explains how a base class can require that derived classes implement specific methods.

# Anonymous Income Comparison Program
A console app that asks for information about two people's jobs and compares how much money they make in a year.

# ArrayAndListSelectionApp
This program demonstrates the use of arrays and lists. It allows users to select items from a collection and illustrates how data can be stored and accessed.

# Boolean Comparison Program
A simple program that practices Boolean logic by comparing values and printing true or false results.

# CallingMethodsExample
This project demonstrates how methods are defined and invoked in C#, including how to pass values to methods and receive results.

# Car Insurance Approval Program
A basic insurance qualification app that checks a user's age and driving history to determine whether they qualify for insurance.

# CarInsurance
This project builds on the insurance idea and uses classes to represent insurance data. It demonstrates how objects are created and used together.

# CodeFirstNewDatabaseSample
An example of creating a database using code. Models are written first and used to generate a database structure.

# ConsoleApp
A basic console application used to practice C# fundamentals like input, output, and program structure.

# ConstructorChainingDemo
This project demonstrates constructor chaining, in which one constructor calls another to reuse code and simplify class initialization.

# DivisionExample
A simple math program that performs division and includes error handling for invalid input or division by zero.

# IQuittable
This project demonstrates how interfaces work in C#. A class implements an interface and provides its own version of the required method.

# InheritanceExample
An example of class inheritance that shows how one class can inherit properties and methods from another.

# LambdaDemo
This project introduces lambda expressions and demonstrates how they can be used to write shorter, cleaner code when working with collections.

# MainMethodExample
Demonstrates how the Main method works and how values can be passed into a program when it starts.

# MathOpsExample
A simple math application that performs basic arithmetic operations using methods in a separate class.

# MethodExample
This example focuses on developing and applying methods for organizing code and avoiding repetition.

# OperatorOverloadDemo
Demonstrates how operators like "+" can be customized to work with user-defined classes.

# ParsingEnumsDemo
Shows how to convert enum values to and from strings or numbers in a readable and straightforward way.

# Shipping Quote Program
A console app that calculates a shipping quote based on package size and weight entered by the user.

# StringBuilder Demo
This project demonstrates how to use the StringBuilder class to manipulate strings efficiently.

# Student Daily Report
A console program that collects information from a student, such as course progress and study time, and displays a summary.

# TextAppender
Demonstrates how to write text to a file and append new data without overwriting existing content.

# TimeCalculatorApp
A program that asks the user for a number and calculates what the time will be after a certain number of hours.

# TryCatchExample
This example demonstrates how to use try-catch blocks to prevent a program from crashing due to invalid input or errors.
